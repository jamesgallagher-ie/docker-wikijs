# docker-wikijs

## This image should not in any way be depended upon - it's a WIP

Getting started with publishing images. 

The goal of this particular image is to be able to run Wiki.js easily with Docker. Currently my plan is to have it part of a Docker Compose setup with MongoDB in a separate container
